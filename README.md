# Algorithms-
he course in algorithms introduces the participants to the most common programming techniques. Along with this, many algorithmic problems are solved and an analysis of different approaches is performed - their properties, applications, advantages and disadvantages. You will develop your skills for algorithmic thinking and you will acquire skills for working with the main classes of algorithms used in practice: recursion and backtracking, recursion using variables, combinatorial algorithms, search, sorting and greedy algorithms, as well as graph theory - realization in computer memory, crawling and finding the shortest path. You will also acquire skills for applying dynamic programming in solving optimization tasks.
